So the note says we need to find someone‚Äôs social media account. They have given certain hints to find the account.

-   _The username comprises of name and the zip-code of current residence_
-   _The username is 15 characters long._
-   _We need to find the name of the blinking man in the image._
-   _The format is_ **_Name_zipcode_**_._
-   _If the name is thomas mueller then write the name as ThomasMueller._

Let‚Äôs see what is in that image.

image of blinking man

It is the iconic blinking man meme. We need to find his real name.

So his name is Drew Scanlon. So the password will be **DrewScanlon_***.** We need to find his pin-code of current residence. Let‚Äôs see his [twitter account](https://twitter.com/drewscanlon).

While taking a peek at his twitter account, we came to a conclusion that he lives in San Francisco, California. Let‚Äôs find the pin-code of [San Francisco](https://www.zip-codes.com/city/ca-san-francisco.asp).

So the pincode is 941***. We need only the first three numbers since the username is 15 characters long. So the username will be **DrewScanlon_941.**

After searching this username in almost all Social Media platforms, I found this account on [twitter](https://twitter.com/DrewScanlon_941).
